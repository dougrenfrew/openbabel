__NOTE:__ _This vopy of OpenBabel has been modified to produce v2000 mol files with v3000 aromatic bonds rather than the standard Kekulé arrangment of alternating single and double bonds._

* Read, write and convert over 90 chemical file formats
* Filter and search molecular files using SMARTS and other methods
* Generate 2D and 3D coordinates for SMILES, InChI and other formats
* Supports molecular modeling, cheminformatics, bioinformatics,
  organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, solid-state materials,
  nuclear chemistry...
